### Frontend Structure Template

The creation of this document should ensure alignment with the **Development Documentation** and **Development Guidelines** that AppDev has created.

The output file `FrontendStructure.md` should be in **Markdown format** to facilitate clarity, maintainability, and ease of collaboration.

### **1. Purpose of the Frontend Structure Document**

- Define the organization and structure of the frontend codebase, tailored to the specific technology stack and project needs.
- Ensure consistency across the application by adopting a top-down approach, starting with global configurations and cascading uniformity to all components.
- Leverage reusable components and centralized configuration (via `.env`) to enhance maintainability, scalability, and efficiency.

# Frontend Structure Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the structure and design principles for the frontend codebase. It aligns with the **Development Documentation** and **Development Guidelines** to ensure consistency, reusability, and scalability across the application.

- **Frontend Stack**: [Specify stack, e.g., React, Angular, Svelte, Vue]
- **Key Libraries**: [Specify, e.g., TailwindCSS, Material UI, Bootstrap, SCSS]
- **Guiding Principles**: Top-down design, modularity, centralized configuration, and reusability.

## Project Structure

```plaintext
src/
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
├── layouts/          # Application-wide layout components
├── views/            # Page-level components
├── styles/           # Global and theme styles
├── state/            # State management files
├── utils/            # Shared utility functions
├── api/              # API integration and configuration
├── assets/           # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
├── config/           # Configuration and environment variables
└── tests/            # Test files for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
```

### Folder Descriptions

1. **`components/`**: Modular and reusable UI components.  
   - Each component follows a structured hierarchy for consistency:
     ```plaintext
     components/
     ├── Button/
     │   ├── Button.tsx
     │   ├── Button.module.css
     │   └── Button.test.ts
     ```
   - Naming Convention: PascalCase.

2. **`layouts/`**: Centralized layout components (e.g., Header, Footer, Sidebar).  

3. **`views/`**: Page-specific components and logic.  

4. **`styles/`**:  
   - `styles/global.css`: Global styles and resets.  
   - `styles/theme.js`: Centralized theming configuration for colors, typography, and spacing.  

5. **`state/`**: Application state management using chosen libraries (e.g., Redux, Context API).  

6. **`utils/`**: Shared utilities and helpers (e.g., formatters, validators).  

7. **`api/`**: Centralized API calls and integration logic.  

8. **`assets/`**: Static assets (e.g., images, icons, fonts).  

9. **`config/`**: Contains the app configuration utilities.  

10. **`tests/`**: Testing files for different types of tests.

## Reusable Component Architecture

- **Top-Down Design**: Create foundational components and extend them hierarchically.
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniformity in props and styles across components.
- **Example**:
  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';

  interface ButtonProps {
      label: string;
      onClick: () => void;
      variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  }

  const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, onClick, variant = 'primary' }) => (
      <button className={`btn-${variant}`} onClick={onClick}>
          {label}
      </button>
  );

  export default Button;
  ```

---

## Styling and Theming

- **Centralized Styling**:
  - Use `theme.js` or equivalent for theming.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    export const theme = {
        colors: {
            primary: '#3498db',
            secondary: '#2ecc71',
        },
        typography: {
            fontSize: '16px',
            fontFamily: 'Arial, sans-serif',
        },
    };
    ```
- **Responsive Design**: Implement mobile-first design principles.  

---

## State Management

- Organize states into `state/` with modular patterns:
  ```plaintext
  state/
  ├── auth/
  │   ├── authSlice.ts
  │   └── authActions.ts
  ├── user/
  │   ├── userSlice.ts
  │   └── userActions.ts
  ```

---

## Routing

- Organize routes in a centralized file.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const routes = [
      { path: '/', component: Home },
      { path: '/login', component: Login },
  ];
  ```

---

## API Integration

- Use a centralized file for API calls:
  ```javascript
  import axios from 'axios';

  const apiClient = axios.create({
      baseURL: process.env.API_URL,
  });

  export default apiClient;
  ```

---

## Environment Variables

- Use `.env` for configuration:
  ```plaintext
  API_URL=https://api.example.com
  APP_ENV=production
  ```
- Access variables consistently via a `config.js` file:
  ```javascript
  export const config = {
      apiUrl: process.env.API_URL,
      env: process.env.APP_ENV,
  };
  ```

---

## Accessibility and Performance

- Ensure compliance with WAI-ARIA standards.
- Optimize performance using lazy loading, memoization, and efficient state management.

---

## Testing Strategy

- Use tools like Jest or Cypress.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
  import Button from '../components/Button';

  test('renders button with label', () => {
      render(<Button label="Click Me" onClick={() => {}} />);
      expect(screen.getByText('Click Me')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  ```
