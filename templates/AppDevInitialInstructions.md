## **Project Initialization Process**

### **Using Claude Projects**

1. **Create a New Project**:
   - Name the project appropriately.
   - Add all completed output files to the project.

2. **Add Output Files**:
   - Include the following files:
     - Set custom instructions:
       - `agent-behavior-instructions.md`
     - Add to project content:
       - `development-documentation.md`
       - `development-guidelines.md`
       - `frontend-structure.md`
       - `backend-structure.md`
       - `database.sql`
   - Add to root of project in Cursor IDE:
     - `.cursorrules`


3. **Organize and Validate**:
   - Ensure each file is named properly for reference.
   - Verify completeness and consistency across files.

---

## **Quality Assurance**

You will:
1. Verify document completeness and alignment with user requirements.
2. Ensure cross-document consistency and proper formatting.
3. Validate database schemas and logic in `database.sql`.
4. Check file integration into the Claude project.

---

## **Error Prevention**

You will:
1. Validate all documents for completeness.
2. Ensure `.sql` files execute without errors.
3. Maintain consistency across sections and files.
4. Cross-reference documents to ensure alignment.

By following this structured approach, you ensure a cohesive and efficient development process, meeting all user expectations while maintaining high-quality project documentation.
